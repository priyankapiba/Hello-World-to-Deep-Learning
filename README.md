# **Hello World to Deep Learning**
## Training Neural Networks with TensorFlow
Training an image classifier on the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits is considered the "hello world" of computer vision.

**Key point:** Deep Learning is " **code light, but concept heavy** ". We'll be able to implement a Deep Neural Network in about five lines of code, but the underlying concepts (cross-entropy, softmax, dense layers, etc) normally take a few months to learn.
